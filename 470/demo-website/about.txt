The Vagrantfile sets up port forwarding on port 5000, as this is the port flask uses. 
Make sure port 5000 is open before executing the 'vagrant up', or the command will fail. 
If port 5000 is not open, end whatever process is using the port. 

After the vagrant up command completes (it will take a few minutes to install all the
dependencies), you can access the app from http://192.168.33.10:5000/

We utilized a bootstrap theme for the overall look and feel. 

Home page: exemplifies how Flask apps can easily use tools such as bootstrap.
Databases page: exemplifies how to use SQL and MongoDB databases with flask.
Sessions page: exemplifies secure sessions. The user you attempt to sign in as
               must exist in the SQL database, i.e. you must create the user first.
Debugger page: is used for showing off the debugger. By default, the app is not
               running in debug mode. If you want to enable debug mode to view the
               stacktrace in the browser window, you need to SSH into the vagrant
               server, execute the command 'export FLASK_DEBUG=1', and then restart
               the app.
